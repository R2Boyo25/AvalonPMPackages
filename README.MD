# Packages repo for [AvalonPackageManager](https://github.com/R2Boyo25/AvalonPackageManager)

# Package Tree
```
Username
    └Repository
        ├package
        └other files (compile script, install script) (optional)
```

for example, for my [PowderSim](https://github.com/R2Boyo25/PowderSim) repo, it would be:
```
R2Boyo25
    └PowderSim
        ├package
        └compile.sh
```

# Note

I plan on switching to a different system eventually so that this does not have a single main repository and people can instead create their own.
